# Server-Monitoring
This Python script uses Tkinter and Paramiko to monitor and manage services on multiple remote hosts via SSH. It allows adding hosts and services dynamically, checks service statuses, and provides an interface to restart services if needed. The GUI displays real-time status updates and logs activities for easy monitoring.
